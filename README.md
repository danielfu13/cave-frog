  ## Project Description

 The purpose of this project is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with MySQL database. Since e-commerce is the largest sector of the electronic industry, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit me as a full-stack web developer.

```
Then open up a terminal window and use the following commands: 

```text
$ npm install

```

  ## Usage

The use of this back end e-commerce application is to use Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with MySQL database. With this application, you can alter different routes and data to fit your personal needs.
